# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

I improved the code by making the `TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY` and `MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH` constants global to the file, as they can be reused in other future functions and don't need to be declared every time the `deterministicPartitionKey` function is called. I also consolidated the repeated calculation of the hash into a separate and reusable function called `generateHash`, making the code more maintainable and scalable. I reduced the number of `if` statements in the code, making it easier to read and follow, by adding a return of `TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY` if there is no event provided, using the `||` operator to check if `event.partitionKey` exists a, using a ternary operator to check if candidate is a string and used ternary operator again for the final return to check the length of candidate and provide the hash if it exceeds `MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH`. My version is more readable because the removal of unnecessary if-statements and the use of ternary operators improve readability and make it easier to follow the flow of the code. Also the use of early return for the trivial partition key reduces the number of calculations performed, making the code more efficient and as i mentioned before the use of reusable functions and constants improves the scalability of the code and make it more clean and maintainable.
